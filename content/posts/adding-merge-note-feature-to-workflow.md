- i use merge note feature in obsidian in my [workflow](https://github.com/nicholas-long/environment/blob/main/zet/20221008061845/README.md)
  - clean up old notes
  - update all the backlinks of a note to point to a new one
- i wanted a similar feature within [zkvr, which is my terminal user interface graph IDE]({{< ref "zettelkasten-github-tui-zkvr-project.md" >}})
- the resulting workflow is really engaging.
  - i feel like i am building up larger and larger notes organically.
    - copying text between notes
    - appending whole notes into other notes with merges
- immediately merged dozens of notes
  - commit messages newest to oldest after implementing merge feature
